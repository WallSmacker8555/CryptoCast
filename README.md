# CryptoCast

## Inspiration
We were motivated to solve issues that existed in traditional off-chain elections. People have lost faith in our elections and we hope that CryptoCast will bring that faith back. Additionally, there is an added problem of low voter turnout because many people are unable to cast their vote using traditional methods and even newer, popular methods such as vote-by-mail. We hope to bring the power to the people by bringing the ballot to them in hopes of creating fairer, more secure, and more representative elections.

## What it does
CryptoCast is a secure and streamlined interface that allows voters to register and cast their votes for elections.

## How we built it
We built our interface with a standard frontend tech stack, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS without the use of any frameworks. This was built on a backend consisting of Solidity and JS.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating the backend with the frontend. The hardest part about that was migrating the information from the form submissions to the smart contract.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We felt accomplished about utilizing blockchain technology in our own programs for the first time.

## What we learned
We learned how to use Solidity for creating smart contracts and integrating with a standard frontend interface.

## What's next for CryptoCast
We plan to expand to non-political voting such as shareholder or NGO voting. Additionally, we would like to increase the complexity of our hash function to ensure that voter information stays private.
